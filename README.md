# QAAutomationExample
Here is the requested example.  I've written it as a TestNG test.  I hope that's alright.  If not, let me know how you'd like it.  According to the criteria outlined in the instructions, the test actually fails.  Some of the titles do not contain the word 'Table', but I've used a soft assert so that all required behavior occurs and the test fails afterward.  [Here is the requested testcase](https://github.com/normalPerson123/QAAutomationExample/tree/main/QATest/src/test/java).
